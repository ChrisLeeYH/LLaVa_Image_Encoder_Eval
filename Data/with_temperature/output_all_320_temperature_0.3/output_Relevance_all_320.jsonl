Tropical forests are known to be carbon sinks, absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate greenhouse gas concentrations. However, deforestation and land use changes can lead to massive emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change. The presence of a river also suggests that this ecosystem is part of a larger watershed, which can be affected by climate change through altered water cycles or increased flooding due to sea level rise. Overall, the image represents an important natural resource in terms of its role in climate change mitigation and adaptation."}
